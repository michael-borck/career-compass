## 🌟 What is Career Compass?

Career Compass is a **privacy-first desktop application** that helps you explore career paths based on your skills, interests, and experience. Unlike online career tools, **all processing happens locally on your device** - your resume and personal data never leave your computer.

### 🔒 Privacy-First Philosophy

- **Local Processing**: All file analysis happens on your device
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect, store, or transmit your personal information
- **Secure Storage**: API keys are encrypted and stored locally using OS-native secure storage
- **No Tracking**: Zero analytics, cookies, or external tracking

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Multiple AI Providers
Choose from multiple AI providers or run models locally:
- **OpenAI** (GPT models)
- **Anthropic Claude** 
- **Google Gemini**
- **Groq** (fast inference)
- **Ollama** (fully local, privacy-first)

### 📄 File Upload Support
Upload your resume in multiple formats:
- **PDF** documents
- **Microsoft Word** (.docx)
- **Markdown** files

### 🔧 Configurable Settings
- Environment variable support for API keys
- Persistent settings across app restarts
- Connection testing for all providers
- Model management (especially for Ollama)

### 🎯 Career Exploration

- Skills analysis and mapping
- Interactive career path visualization
- Based on your actual experience and interests
